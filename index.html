    <p id = "text1948" class = "textBoxes">Acts pre-Apartheid: <br><br>1. The Black Laws Amendment act No. 46 - 1937<br> This act restricted the ability of black people to own land without explicit approval by the government. This meant that many black people in South Africa were unable to own land, and therefore had to live on the reserved land put in place by the government. These areas were unclean, unkept, and often crowded. Meanwhile, white people had full freedom of choosing where to live, and could even force a black family off of their own land to take it due to law such as this act.<br>  2. The Natives act No.21 - 1923 <br> This act created the designated black territories describes previously. Black people were often forced to live there after being forcefully evicted from their previous location. These areas were crowded and unkept, and were usually far away from areas where white people lived. This separation is living space further pushed the idea of racial supremacy, and only increased the general mistreatment and discrimination against the black people of South Africa.<br>   3. The Black Land act No. 27 - 1913 <br> This act prohibited the owning of land by black people that wasn't within the boundaries of a reserved area. This meant that only white people could own the rest of the land, which was the vast majority of it compared to the small reserves. These three laws created a cycle of hell for the black citizens of South Africa, as they were unable to own land that wasn't labeled as being for them, could often be forced off their own land since they could no longer own it, and had no choice but to relocate to the reserves, as all other land was strictly for white people. This is just one of the many cycles that created a rigged system for black people in South Africa.</p>

    <p id = "text1950" class = "textBoxes">Organizations: <br><br>1. National Party <br> The National Party was elected to power in 1948. Their campaign message and eventual actions revolved around the idea of Apartheid and racial superiority. They wanted to separate the black and white people of South Africa, as well as suppress the black population. Despite them being the minority in terms of race, one of the party's first actions was to limit the ability of the black population to vote, meaning that they could pass laws only with the support of the minority, allowing them to pass the following suppressive acts. Their control would end in 1994, after years of international condemnation and pressure, both political and social.<br>2. African National Congress (ANC) <br> The African National Congress was first created in the early 1900's with the intent on reforming the laws in South Africa after the effects of European colonization. Their goals soon changed as the National Party began to enact their plan of Apartheid and suppress the black population. With leaders such as Nelson Mandela, the party hosted protests and rallies to speak out against the National Party. In later years, they would switch to more aggressive strategies, and engaged in guerilla warfare with the government. This would cause Mandela and other leaders to be imprisoned. Despite setbacks, the party countinued its efforts, and eventually succeeded, as they were voted into power with Mandela as president in 1994, where they were able to undo suppressive Apartheid acts.<br>3. South African National Civics Organization <br> The South African National Civics Organization was aimed to handle civil services in the designated areas imposed by the government where the black citizens of South Africa were forced to live. As will discussed later, many of these services were scarce or non-existant in these reserved areas. The S.A.N.C.O took over these roles, keeping the areas well kept and clean, aiding public health, as well as inspiring people with protests and movements. In a few instances, the S.A.N.C.O even aided in hostile attacks against the National Party.</p>
    
    <p id = "text1960" class = "textBoxes">Acts during Apartheid: <br><br>1. The Group Areas Act - 1950 <br>This act set aside areas for each race to live, work, and be socially accepted in. Other races could not live or work in the other areas, and rarely visited. Laws like these created more division between black and white citizens of South Africa. This physical division also fueled a mental one, as the ideas of racial superiority that had fueled Apartheid were further strengthened by this injustice.<br> 2. The Extension of University Education Act - 1959 <br>This law reduced the ability for universities and other higher education schools to accept non-white applicants. This restricted the ability for black people to attend a university in the country, and would often be forced to leave the country, if they even had the funds to do so. Like the Group Areas Act, this stoked the fire of racist ideology, as those who got an education looked down on those who didn't. The more division they felt physically, the more division they felt mentally, as black and white citizens of South Africa were spread farther apart. <br> 3. The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act - 1970 <br> This act stripped black citizens of South Africa of their citizenship, and made them citizens of a Bantustan tribe, regardless of where they lived or their actual ethnicity. As if what they were going through wasn't enough, they were now no longer citizens of their own country, and this was decided by intrusive people who believed that they were racially superior to the local citizens. Citizenship comes with rights and privileges, but its simply the idea that gives people pride in their country and in themselves. It can only be imagined how it must feel to lose that which you are so proud of for no good reason, simply because those who look down upon you decide it to be so.</p>

    <p id = "text1970" class = "textBoxes">Examples of Oppression: <br><br>1. Restriction in living area <br> One of the main oppressive conditions that the black population of South Africa faced was their living conditions and living area. Certain zones were set aside for black people to live in, but they could only live there, while non-black individuals had the freedom of choice. This could result in forced eviction and relocation to these new areas. These designated zones were usually in bad condition, and did not receive the same services as the white areas. <br>     2. Restriction in voting and marriage <br> Marriage restriction was one of the worst social acts passed to target the black population. Restriction of black and white marriage split families, and forced others to live separately from each other. The voting restriction may be the worst, because it allowed all other acts to be passed. One of the first acts passed by the National Party was to restrict the ability of the black population to vote. This meant that they were able to pass racist and discriminatory laws and restricions against them without their resistance. The black people of South Africa could only watch as laws such as those that banned and restricted basic rights such as marriage and freedom of choice were passed.<br>    3. General Mistreatment and Racism <br> The worst result of the Apartheid oppression in South Africa was the general mistreatment and discrimination against the black population. Despite being the majority race in the area, as well as having been living there for hundreds of years, the intrusive white colonizers from centuries before destroyed the remnants of their former lives and condtions. The white people in South Africa held the ideology of white supremacy, and this was the root cause of Apartheid. Black african people were subject to racist verbal abuse, as well as discrimination in their rights and abilities simply due to the color of their skin. They were treated horribly by people who had intruded on, enslaved, and killed their people for centuries prior.</p>

    <p id = "text1980" class = "textBoxes">Important People: <br><br>1. Nelson Mandela <br>Nelson Mandela was a very influential figure during the anti-Apartheid movement. He was the son of a tribal chief who fought with the African National Congress (ANC) to end the Apartheid Oppression. He was one of the first to switch from peaceful protest to aggresive guerilla tactics against the National Party Military. These actions would cause him to be incarcerated for almost 30 years. While in prison, he wrote speeches and other works aiding the cause, and he was still hailed as a hero of the movement.<br>   2. Helen Suzman <br>Helen Suzman was a memeber of the Progressive Party in South Africa, and was one of the only members who took an active stance against the National Party. Despite ridicule, she persisted in advocating for the repeal of Apartheid acts and work towards equality. Later, she would go on to serve on the Independent Electoral Commission, which would hold the first democratic elections in South Africa since the start of Apartheid, electing Nelson Mandela as president. Suzman later received the United Nations award for International League of Human Rights for her work.<br>     3. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela <br> Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was known as an anti-Apartheid herione. Despite being imprisoned for almost 500 days, where she was repeatedly beaten, and then banished to another town, she never gave in. Madikizela-Mandela continued to inspire young women to become active in politics, and to join in her fight to end Apartheid. She was later awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award for her brave and inspiring efforts.</p>
    
    <p id = "text1990" class = "textBoxes">International Responses: <br><br>1. United States <br>After going through a similar dilema in the late 1960's with the Civil Rights movement, many people in the United States, both black and white, were eager to spread the same message to other parts of the world. South Africa was the main subject of their support. Protest groups and activists set up protests, raised awareness and funds, and even went to South Africa to help their situation. Politically, the United States governent imposed sanctions on South African exports, as they would not financially support a country that subjected its citizens to such atrocities.  <br> 2. Europe <br>European countries began to join the movement against the National Party in South Africa. Not too long before, many European countries pulled their control of the colonies that they had made at the beginning of the century. This was due to massive protest and pressure from activists who said that their colonial ideas were outdated and inhumane. These same activists saw the events of Apartheid in South Africa as remnants of the former European colonies in South Africa. As seen in the previous image, protests in Britain and other European nations advocated for weapons to no longer be sent to South Africa in hopes of reducing bloodshed. Like the United States, the United Nations and European Union soon placed sanctions and tarrifs on South African exports in hopes of strangling it econimically. Their conditions to end their tarrifs were for the National Party to peel back its acts that oppressed the black citizens of South Africa. The National Party, under F.W. de Klerk, was soon forced to comply.<br> 3. Other Nations <br>Many Asian and other African countries amassed support for the resistance movements against Apartheid. Many activist groups raised money and awareness for groups such as the ANC. With international pressure and heavy sanctions, the National Party had no choice but to begin repealing the acts. On February 11, 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from prison after serving almost 40 years. This was seen as a major victory for the resistance movements, and the world rejoiced.</p>
